Rhetoric questions will assess you on how well you understand the choices
that authors make in structuring and developing their texts.

5 main types
  Analyzing word choice:
    about determining the meaning of words and phrases in context.
    Focus less on definitions and more on rhetorical impact.
    No standard phrasing to these questions, they call put certian
    words and ask you to consider the purpose or effect
  Analyzing text structure:
    One kind will ask you to characterize in some way the overall structure of the passage
      This could be as simple as recognizing the basic organizing princable
        cause-effect, sequence or problem solution.
      Most cases the questions will be more complicated and shaped by the content
      of the passage
        you may have to track how the structure shifts over the course of a passage
        "The passage begins by doing x, then does y"
      To answer this question, you'll have to think abstractly and identify the major change in
      focus that occurs in the passage.
  Analyzing point of view:
    This includes the stance, attitude or bias of the author, narrator or speaker.
    will have the words "perspective" and "point of view"
    The awnser choices offer characterization of the author, narrator or speaker.
  Analyzing purpose:
    You'll have to think abstractly about the text, you'll consider the main purpose or function
    of the whole passage or of a significant part of the passage.
    The word "Purpose" or "Function" are in these questions.
  Analyzing arguments:
    The test includes passages that are primarily argumentative
    A question that asks about the central claim of an argument.
    You'll have to decide on the primary assertion that the author is trying to make
    Distinguish secondary assertions and details.
    "Claim" "counterClaim" "reason" "evidence"
